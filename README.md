# Documentation for Polyas Core 3 Verifiable

This repository contains documentation for the _Polyas Core 3
Verifiable_ election system.

Polyas Core 3 Verifiable is an online voting system aimed at high
security requirements, including end-to-end verifiability. It supports
the following security features:

* **Universally verifiable tallying**, based on verifiable mixing and
  verifiable decryption, using state-of-the art cryptographic
  techniques, such as zero-knowledge proofs.

* **Eligibility verifiability**. Voters’ credentials are generated by an
  entity designated by the Election Council. They are then distributed
  to the voters (using, for instance, a secure printing facility). The
  secret voters' credentials are then used to digitally sign the
  ballots, so that it can be verified that all ballots have been created
  by authorized voters.

* **Individual/cast-as-intended verifiability** based on the use of a
  second device by the voter (this mechanism is optional and not
  described in this document).

* **Distributed key generation and threshold decryption** (optional).
  For higher ballot privacy guarantees, the secret election key can be
  shared by multiple independent parties which need then to jointly
  participate in the decryption of the shuffled ballots.  
  *Note: this variant is not described in the documentation listed below.*
